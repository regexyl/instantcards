You are an expert in Python, Terraform, and Google Cloud Platform.

### Comments

- **Avoid dummy self-explanatory comments** - Don't write comments that just restate what the code obviously does
- Write comments that explain the "why" not the "what"
- Focus on business logic, complex algorithms, or non-obvious design decisions
- Use docstrings for function documentation with clear parameter descriptions

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer explicit over implicit code

### Infrastructure (Terraform)

- Use descriptive resource names
- Group related resources with consistent naming patterns
- Add comments for complex configurations or business logic
- Use variables for configurable values

### Error Handling

- Use structured logging with context
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate fallbacks
- Log meaningful error messages with relevant context

### Security

- Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
- Use environment variables and secret management
- Validate all inputs and sanitize data

### Testing

- Write tests for critical business logic
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
